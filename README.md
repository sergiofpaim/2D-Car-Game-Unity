# 2D-Car-Game-Unity
2D Car Game made for windows forms, adapted to the Unity engine.

Pre-College study #5

# About this study exercise
This game was my fifth coding exercise, it was created so that I could understand about how to adapt a game from one engine to another.
## Previous stage
I had just created the 2D Car Game using windows forms.

### Challenge 
My challenge was to migrate the simulation logic that was first built in the Windows Forms 2D Car Game (on top of its proprietary engine) to the Unity Engine.
The hardest part was to figure out how to structure the game (visual and simulation) logic in a way other than simply following most of the tutorials that teach keeping the logic into a few Mono Behaviours related to view game components.
We managed to preserve more than 99% of the simulation logic from the original [WinForm game](https://github.com/sergiofpaim/2D-Car-Game), and derived a design style that can grow to thousands of game components.

### Next Stage
My next step is to start studying at the university.
